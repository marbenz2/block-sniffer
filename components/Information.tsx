      <p>
        Founded in 2015, the VeChain Foundation went on to launch the
        VeChainThor public blockchain in 2018, a fully programmable,
        EVM-compatible layer one smart contract platform. Its unique two-token
        model ensures stable, low transaction costs while an advanced Proof of
        Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism guarantees high throughput,
        scalability, and security with minimal energy consumption. VeChainThorâ€™s
        robust architecture has seen zero downtime for the network after 4 years
        of continuous operation. Strong independent capabilities combined with
        the professional compliance guidance of strategic partners PwC and DNV
        has allowed vechain to establish partnerships with leading enterprises
        including Walmart China, Bayer China, BMW Group, BYD Auto, H&M Group,
        Shanghai Gas, LVMH, and more. vechain continues to pioneer real-world
        blockchain applications across the globe with offices in Luxembourg,
        China, Singapore, San Marino, Milan, Ireland, Japan, France and the
        United States, working on wide-ranging applications from supply chain &
        logistics, sustainability & SDGs, carbon emissions, energy, medicine,
        DeFi, NFTs and much more.
